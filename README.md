# Inspiration
The impact of the STEM fields in today's world is ever-growing. However, we recognize that there exists a stigma towards studying in them as they are too "difficult" or math heavy. We believe that by automating common rote calculations, students will be able to focus more on the important, physical concepts

# What it does

KineMagic is an Android application that lets one plug in variables for the given kinematics problem. The user will then be given a solution for the variable that they are solving for with units with the option of graphing the displacement time graph on a Cartesian plane. The application simply requires you just to plug in the variables that are known in the problem you are solving. 

# How we built it

We used Android Studio to build the app. The XML files is used for interface design and the Java files are used to calculate the unknown variable. We used XML to allow users to interact with the calculator and input variables. There were no APIs used in this porject and we strated everything from scratch. Linking the XML files to Java consist of calling the input files back and forward. The calculation part of Java reads through the given input and run through the algorithm to determine whether or not there is an answer. If there is , it returns the answer with the correct units to the screen.

Run the application

Simply download/clone the source code from GitHub link provided and run on Android studio. It is required to use a physical Android device as it requires use of the camera - not possible on emulator.
