# Inspiration
The impact of the STEM fields in today's world is ever-growing. However, we recognize that there exists a stigma towards studying in them as they are too "difficult" or math heavy. We believe that by automating common rote calculations, students will be able to focus more on the important, physical concepts

# What it does

KineMagic is an Android application that lets one plug in variables for the given kinematics problem. The user will then be given a solution for the variable that they are solving for with units with the option of graphing the displacement time graph on a Cartesian plane. The application simply requires you just to plug in the variables that are known in the problem you are solving.
